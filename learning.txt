What I have learned from this course
So far in the ALX Foundations of Linux and Version Control course, I have learned key skills in using Git and GitHub effectively. I have grasped how to fork repositories, make commits, create pull requests, and save or update files on GitHub. Additionally, I have successfully cloned repositories to my local machine and am now working on updating my local repository to keep it in sync with the remote version. These skills are helping me build a solid foundation in version control and collaborative software development.
